# EVO

Project "EVO" is an open soruce modern educational platform that is innovating the way students learn, using psychological frameworks. This platform is designed to provide a highly personalized and adaptive learning environment that addresses each student's unique needs and characteristics.

Drawing on the concept of 16 personalities and personality accentuation theory, EVO can identify and analyze each student's individual personality traits, learning styles, and preferences. Using this information, we develop an individualized learning plan that maximizes the student's strengths and helps them overcome their weaknesses, ultimately leading to improved academic performance and increased student satisfaction.
